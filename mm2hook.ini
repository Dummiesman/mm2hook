However, this will cause a new issue where the car body will be invisible behind a breakable object with transparency (such as with the default LTV).
ModelVisibility=0             ; Allows you to see a vehicle's body from the dashboard and bumper camera. Be advised that many cars are not set up to properly support this, and it may look strange in many cases.
#Start of light settings.
#By default, only HEADLIGHT and SRN objects are used. These are represented by the glow effect you can see when these lights are on.
#The settings below allow you to enable support for the original HLIGHT and SIREN objects used by Midtown Madness 1, which allow for much more flexibility in how lighting can work.
#Some newer addon cars use these objects for enhanced lighting effects.
#Please note that every unmodified vanilla game vehicle, and many addon vehicles, will look a bit broken with these objects enabled, as they were not correctly set up.

[Dashboards]
# This section allows you to enable and tune an experimental dashboard head bobbing effect.

HeadBobOffsetScaleY=0.0125        ; Up/down offset scale.
HeadBobOffsetScaleZ=0.0125        ; Forward/backward offset scale.

# These options control how much steering rotation affects up/down movement (kind of like body roll).
# The speed factor controls how much of an effect Z-velocity has on this.
# Typically there won't be an effect at a stand-still, only at higher velocities.
HeadBobSteeringFactor=0.001875
HeadBobSteeringSpeedFactor=1.125
HeadBobVelocityScaleY=0.00075     ; Up/down velocity effect scale.

HeadBobMultiplierZ=1.0            ; Forward/backward multiplier.
