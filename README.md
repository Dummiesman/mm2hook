[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/96k957iuc4l9susg?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Dummiesman/mm2hook)

A simple DLL-injection module for hooking into Midtown Madness 2, allowing for further control of the game.

Also included are complimentary bug-fixes for random crashes, as well as a fix for the infamous **heap overrun** error.

## Features

 * Console output window
 * Lua scripting
 
 * ### [Discord Rich Presence](https://discordapp.com/rich-presence) Integration:
   * Dynamically updates based on the state of your game (playing a race, cruising around, in the main menu, etc.)
   * Shows a thumbnail picture for default vehicles/cities
     - Thumbnail text shows the full name (mods included!)
 
## Installation
1) Grab the latest version [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Fireboyd78/mm2hook/build/artifacts).
2) **Optional:** Download the latest version of Discord Rich Presence [here](https://github.com/discordapp/discord-rpc/releases/latest), and grab `discord-rpc.dll` from the `win32-dynamic\bin` folder.
3) Place all files in your Midtown Madness 2 installation directory and enjoy!

**Note for Wine users:** In order to use this on Wine, you must open winecfg, go to the Libraries tab, and add an override for dinput. Set the override to either "native" or "native then builtin"

## Building
Using a recent version of the Visual Studio IDE (including Visual Studio 2022 14.39) *should* more or less work as expected. If you'd prefer to use something else, a [simple build script](build.bat) is also available.

Note that this still requires installing parts of the [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022) to work:

- `C++/CLI support for v143 build tools` (latest should be fine)
- `MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools` (latest should be fine)
- `C++ ATL for latest v143 build tools (x86 & x64)`
- `C++ MFC for latest v143 build tools (x86 & x64)`
- `Windows 10 SDK (10.0.18362.0)`
- `Windows Universal C Runtime`
- `C++ Build Tools core features`
- `C++ core features`
